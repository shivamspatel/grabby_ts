    <h2>Description of the Service</h2>

    <p>
      The Service is a technology platform that provides an online marketplace
      which enables connections between Merchants who wish to list, offer, sell,
      and deliver Retail items including but not limited to alcohol items
      ("Item(s)") to customers who browse and purchase Items. Users who purchase
      Items through the Service are "Customer(s)," and users who list, and sell
      Items through the Service are "Merchant(s)." A user may be both a Customer
      and Merchant. All purchases are made directly (and any contract for
      purchase and sale is) between the Customer and Merchant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store offers a marketplace—it is not itself a
      Merchant and is not manufacturing, stocking, delivering, packaging, or
      selling any Item. The Service includes enabling users to connect with each
      other and related services, but we are not a party to any purchase or
      sales transaction. To encourage return use of the Service, Grabbl and/or
      Grabbl Store may also help facilitate the resolution of disputes between
      Customers and Merchants, but Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store has no control
      over and does not guarantee (a) the existence, quality, safety,
      authenticity, or legality of Items offered or sold on the Service; (b) the
      truth or accuracy of a Merchant's content or listings on the Service; (c)
      the ability of a Merchant to sell Items through the Service and deliver
      Items within required delivery windows; (d) the ability of Customers to
      pay for Items purchased through the Service; or (e) that a Customer or
      Merchant will actually complete a transaction, effectuate trouble-free
      delivery and shipping, or return a Item through the Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      Merchants are independent business owners and independent contractors to
      Customers and not employees, partners, representatives, agents, joint
      venturers, or franchisees of Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store. Grabbl and/or
      Grabbl Store does not prepare, package or deliver item and does not employ
      people to prepare, package or deliver item.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each Merchant is solely responsible for complying with all applicable
      laws, rules and regulations and standards, including but not limited to
      those pertaining to the preparation, sale, marketing, packaging, handling,
      and delivery of all Items ordered through Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store, and
      updating details and prices relating to the Items offered. Each Merchant
      is solely liable for the quality, safety, and freshness of its products,
      and Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store does not verify the credentials,
      representations, products, services, or prices offered by any Merchants,
      and does not guarantee the quality of the product or services, or that
      Merchants or Items comply with applicable laws. Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store
      will not be liable or responsible for any Items provided by Merchants that
      are a cause of injury or that do not meet your expectations in any manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on the jurisdiction, Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store may enter into
      agreements with third party independent contractors (each a "Delivery
      Service Provider") to provide delivery services under certain
      circumstances if desirable by individual Merchants or Customers. If a
      Merchant or Customer chooses to use a Delivery Service Provider to deliver
      a Item, Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store is not offering such delivery services
      and has no responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any
      Delivery Service Provider. Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store will not be liable
      or responsible for any delivery services provided by a Delivery Service
      Provider or any errors or misrepresentations made by them. Delivery
      Service Providers are required to comply with all applicable laws, rules
      and regulations.
    </p>

    <h2>Customer Review Guidelines:</h2>
    <p>
      To the extent you are a Customer, Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store may allow you

      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store may accept, reject or remove reviews and any
      associated content in its sole discretion. Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store has
      absolutely no obligation to screen or to delete reviews or associated
      content, even if anyone considers reviews objectionable or inaccurate.
      Those Customers posting reviews should comply with the following criteria:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        reviewers should have firsthand experience with the person/entity being
        reviewed;
      </li>
      <li>
        reviews should not contain: offensive language, profanity, or abusive,
        racist, or hate language; discriminatory references based on religion,
        race, gender, national origin, age, marital status, sexual orientation
        or disability; or references to illegal activity;
      </li>
      <li>
        reviewers should not be affiliated with competitors if posting negative
        reviews;
      </li>
      <li>
        reviewers should not make any conclusions as to the legality of conduct;
      </li>
      <li>
        reviewers may not post any false statements or organize a campaign
        encouraging others to post reviews, whether positive or negative.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Reviews are not endorsed by Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store, and do not
      represent the views of Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store or of any affiliate or
      partner of Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store. Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store does not
      assume liability for any review or for any claims, liabilities or losses
      resulting from any review. Any review you post will be considered User
      Content (as defined below).
    </p>

    <h2>Marketplace Risk:</h2>
    <p>
      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store is not affiliated with or endorsed by any
      Merchant, manufacturer or other Item packaging or delivery services made
      available through the Service. Beyond its capacity as a marketplace and
      technology platform, Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store is not a party to or
      involved in any transaction between Customers and Merchants, and does not
      act as a Customer, Merchant (or affiliate for a Customer or Merchant) or
      broker with respect to any transactions. There are risks that you assume
      when dealing with other users (including those who may be acting under
      false pretenses) and all of these risks are borne by you, and not Grabbl
      and/or Grabbl Store. We encourage you to use the various functionalities
      of the Service (e.g., Merchant profiles, Item options, and user reviews)
      to help evaluate the user with whom you are dealing.
    </p>

    <h2>Merchants as Independent Business Owners / Independent Contractors:</h2>
    <p>
      Users of the Service acting in the capacity of a Merchant do so in their
      personal capacity as an independent business and independent contractor
      and a seller of goods and not as an employee of Grabbl and/or Grabbl
      Store. As a Merchant, you agree that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        you are an independent business owner and not an employee of Grabbl
        and/or Grabbl Store and/or Zyka inc;
      </li>

      transmission of applicable data, if any, is subject to United States
      export controls. No Software may be downloaded from the Service or

    <h2>Commercial Use:</h2>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise expressly authorized herein or in the Service, you agree
      not to display, distribute, license, perform, publish, reproduce,

    </p>
    <h2>ID Verification; Other Safety Checks:</h2>
    <p>
      In some locations, the sale and delivery of alcohol may be permitted
      through the Marketplace. In such jurisdictions, the Merchant must hold a
      valid liquor license that permits the sale of alcohol for delivery, and it
      is the responsibility of such Merchant and any delivery provider they use
      to verify identification and age, and to determine whether it is otherwise
      safe and appropriate to furnish their Customers with alcohol. They may
      require a valid form of photo identification with birthdate and a signed
      acknowledgment confirming acceptance at the time of pick-up or delivery.
      If they cannot verify a Customer’s age or identity, if a Customer appears
      intoxicated, or if the situation is otherwise unsafe or inappropriate (for
      example, the Customer is 25 years old but appears to be in the company of
      only 18 year olds), they may refuse to furnish the Customer with alcohol.
      Alcohol cannot be left unattended (contactless delivery is not available
      for alcohol orders) — someone 21 or older must be present to accept and
      sign for it. If a Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store is unable to deliver your
      product for this or a similar reason, the Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store may
      still charge you for the order. If we believe that your order is
      fraudulent or unlawful, we may suspend your use of the Platform. All
      Users, customers and merchants of Grabbl and/or Grabbl store hereby agree
      that they will not buy for, sell to and/or facilitate in any way shape or
      form, any kind of alcohol or age restricted items listed on our platform
      to any minor.

    <h4>Copyright Complaints:</h4>
    <p>
      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store respects the intellectual property of others,
      and we ask our users to do the same. If you believe that your work has
      been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your
      intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should
      notify Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store of your infringement claim in accordance
      with the procedure set forth below.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store will process and investigate notices of alleged
      infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital
      Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable intellectual
      property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A
      notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Grabbl
      and/or Grabbl Store's Copyright Agent at legal@Grabbl.io (Subject line:
      "DMCA Takedown Request").
    </p>

    <p>
      To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the
      following information:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

        behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property
        interest;
      </li>
      <li>
        a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property
        that you claim has been infringed;

      <li>your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
      <li>
        a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed
        use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner,
        its agent, or the law;
      </li>
      <li>
        a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above
        information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or
        intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or
        intellectual property owner's behalf.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Counter-Notice:</h4>
    <p>
      If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access
      was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from
      the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law,
      to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written
      counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright
      Agent:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>your physical or electronic signature;</li>
      <li>
        identification of the content that has been removed or to which access
        has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before
        it was removed or disabled;
      </li>
      <li>
        a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was
        removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the
        content; and
      </li>
      <li>
        your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement
        that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court located within
        the Northern District of California and a statement that you will accept
        service of process from the person who provided notification of the
        alleged infringement.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Grabbl and/or
      Grabbl Store will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original
      complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed
      content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright
      owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider,
      member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it
      restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the
      counter-notice, at our sole discretion.
    </p>

    <h4>Repeat Infringer Policy:</h4>
    <p>
      In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Grabbl and/or Grabbl

      or not there is any repeat infringement.

      must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor." If you are
      a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or
      doctrine.

    <h2>
      Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION
      CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
    </h2>

    <h3>a. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
    <p>
      This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in
      this Terms of Service as the "Arbitration Agreement." You agree that any
      and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and
      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store, whether arising out of or relating to this
      Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any
      advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us,
      shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration,
      rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration
      Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims
      court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does
      not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state,
      or local agencies, and such agencies, if the law allows, seek relief
      against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this Terms of
      Service, you and Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store are each waiving the right to
      a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be
      determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal
      Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
      Arbitration Agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may opt out of the requirement to arbitrate if you have not previously
      agreed to an arbitration provision in Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store’s Terms
      of Service where you had the opportunity to opt out of the requirement to
      arbitrate. If you have previously agreed to such an arbitration provision,
      you may opt out of any revisions to your prior arbitration agreement made
      by this version of the arbitration agreement in the manner specified
      below, but opting out of this arbitration agreement has no effect on any
      previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with
      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store. Except as specified in this arbitration
      agreement, you may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by notifying
      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store by email at legal@Grabbl.io, within 30 days of
      your agreement to these Terms of Service. To opt out, you must send an
      email with signed written notification at legal@Grabbl.io, that includes
      (a) your account username, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your
      telephone number, (e) your email address associated with your account, and
      (f) a clear statement indicating that you wish to opt out of the
      Arbitration Agreement.
    </p>

    <h3>
      b. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
      Relief
    </h3>
    <p>
      YOU AND GRABBL AND/OR GRABBL STORE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS
      AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
      CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR
      PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND GRABBL AND/OR GRABBL STORE AGREE
      OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE
      PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF
      A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR
      MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF)
      ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE
      EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL
      CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY
      AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED
      FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
    </p>

    <h3>c. Representative PAGA Waiver</h3>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Arbitration
      Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (1) you and Grabbl
      and/or Grabbl Store agree not to bring a representative action on behalf
      of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (“PAGA”),
      California Labor Code § 2698 et seq., in any court or in arbitration, and
      (2) for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including
      under the California PAGA, both you and Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store agree
      that any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual
      basis only (i.e., to resolve whether you have personally been aggrieved or
      subject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used
      to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or
      collective proceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have
      been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively,
      “representative PAGA Waiver”).
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration
      Agreement or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the scope, applicability,
      enforceability, revocability or validity of this representative PAGA
      Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and
      not by an arbitrator. If any provision of this representative PAGA Waiver
      is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason: (i) the
      unenforceable provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (ii)
      severance of the unenforceable provision shall have no impact whatsoever
      on the Arbitration Agreement or the requirement that any remaining Claims
      be arbitrated on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration
      Agreement; and (iii) any such representative PAGA or other representative
      private attorneys general act claims must be litigated in a civil court of
      competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. To the extent that there
      are any Claims to be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction
      because a civil court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
      representative PAGA Waiver is unenforceable with respect to those Claims,
      the Parties agree that litigation of those Claims shall be stayed pending
      the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration.
    </p>

    <h3>d. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>
      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store is always interested in resolving disputes
      amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved
      quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by emailing customer support at
      support@Grabbl.io. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends
      to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a
      written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to Grabbl and/or Grabbl
      Store should be sent to 1137 Princeton Hills Dr, Nolensville, TN 37135.
      The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute
      and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Grabbl and/or Grabbl
      Store and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days
      after the Notice is received, you or Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store may
      commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of
      any settlement offer made by Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store or you shall not
      be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the
      amount, if any, to which you or Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store is entitled.
    </p>

    <h3>e. Arbitration Procedures</h3>
    <p>
      Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with
      the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures,
      including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the "AAA
      Rules"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the
      AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the
      AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's
      consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If
      there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term
      of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration
      Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the
      application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not
      result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also
      follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All
      issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to,
      issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this
      Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually
      simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings,
      the arbitrator awards the same damages and relief on an individual basis
      that a court awards to an individual under the Terms of Service and
      applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and
      may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store and you agree otherwise, any arbitration
      hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both
      parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other
      pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location,
      the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or
      less, Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store agrees that you may choose whether the
      arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted
      to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person
      hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000,
      the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of
      the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall
      issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
      findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
    </p>

    <h3>f. Costs of Arbitration</h3>
    <p>
      Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively,
      the "Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless
      otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the
      relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Grabbl and/or Grabbl
      Store will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought is more
      than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you
      are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if
      the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be
      required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Grabbl and/or Grabbl
      Store will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate
      to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
      compared to the costs of litigation, Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store will pay
      as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to
      prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of
      attorneys' fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
    </p>

    <h3>g. Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>
      All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or
      award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of
      all parties.
    </p>

    <h3>h. Severability</h3>
    <p>
      If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
      Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled "Prohibition
      of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" above)
      is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or
      provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
      comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
      term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as
      so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the
      provisions of subsection (b) above titled "Prohibition of Class and
      Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief" are invalid or
      unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be
      null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or
      unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief.
      The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.
    </p>

    <h3>i. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</h3>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary,
      Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store agrees that if it makes any future change to
      this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address)
      while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by
      sending Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store written notice within thirty (30)
      calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By

      dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration
      Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or
