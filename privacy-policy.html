      general public, and customers can browse and purchase Items (collectively,
      as the “Service”).
    </p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and
      share that data, and your choices concerning our data practices.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    <p>We collect information as follows:</p>

    <h3>Information You Provide:</h3>
    <p>
      We collect information that you provide to Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store when
      (i) filling out or updating required and optional profile information when
      signing up for and using the Service, (ii) contacting us by email, (iii)
      filling out a contact form on the Service; (iv) making a purchase; (v)
      participating in a promotion; or (vi) applying for a job. The information
      collected during these interactions may vary based on what you choose to
      share with us, but it will generally include name, e-mail address,
      telephone number, account credentials, demographic data (such as gender,
      race, and country), your delivery address, other profile data (such as
      your preferences and favorites), employment data (such as your employment
      and education history, transcripts, and references as necessary to
      consider you for open positions), the content of any message you send to
      us or reviews and feedback you submit about Merchant that may be publicly
      posted on the Service at Merchant’s discretion, and the financial
      information necessary to ensure payments can be processed by our payment
      processor. Accordingly, in addition to this Privacy Policy and our Terms
      of Service, information related to your purchases is also processed
      according to Payment Processor's services agreement and privacy policy. We
      collect the content within any messages exchanged between users and
      Merchants through the Service (such as if you use our chat functionality).
      We also collect data about your personal contacts, including the first and
      last name, email address, and phone number of your personal contacts. We
      collect data about your contacts with your consent and in order to fulfill
      a request by you, such as inviting your contacts to join the Service. Such
      functionality is only intended for U.S. residents. By using this
      functionality, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts
      are based in the U.S. and that you have your contacts’ consent for us to
      use their contact information to fulfill your request.
    </p>

    <h3>Information we collect through our social media pages and chatbots:</h3>
    <p>
      We have pages on social media sites like Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and
      Facebook (“Social Media Pages”). When you interact with our Social Media
      Pages (e.g., through our chatbot on Facebook Messenger), we will collect
      the information that you provide to us, such as your contact details,
      location etc. Also, if you publicly reference our Service on social media
      (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store in a
      tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in connection with our
      Service. In addition, the companies that host our Social Media Pages may
      provide us with aggregate information and analytics regarding the use of
      our Social Media Pages.
    </p>

    <h3>Information we collect when you Log-in through Social Media:</h3>
    <p>
      We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Service that allows you to log-in to
      your Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store account through social media. If you
      choose to engage with such integration, we may receive information from
      the social media platform that you have authorized to share with us.
      Please note that the social media platform may independently collect
      information about you through the integration.
    </p>

    <h3>Information we receive automatically from your use of the Service:</h3>
    <p>
      When you visit, use and interact with the Service, we may receive certain
      information about your visit, use or interactions. For example, we may
      monitor the number of people that visit the Service, peak hours of visits,
      which page(s) you visit, which links you click, what text you enter, how
      your mouse moves around the Service, the domains you come from (e.g.,
      google.com, facebook.com, etc.), and which browsers you use to access the
      Service (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.),
      broad geographical information (such as location derived from an IP
      address or data that indicates a city or postal code level) and precise
      location data (such as latitude/longitude data when you enter your address
      for an Order delivery), and navigation patterns. In particular, the
      following information is created and automatically logged in our systems:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Log data:</b> Information that your browser automatically sends
        whenever you visit the Site (“log data”). Log data includes your
        Internet Protocol address, browser type and settings, the date and time
        of your request, and how you interacted with the Site.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Device information:</b> Includes name of the device, operating
        system, internet service provider, your device’s regional and language
        settings, device identifiers (e.g., IP address), and browser you are
        using. Information collected may depend on the type of device you use
        and its settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Usage Information:</b> We collect information about how you use our
        Service, such as the types of content that you view or engage with, the
        features you use, the actions you take (including the items you view and
        purchase), the emails you view, and the time, frequency and duration of
        your activities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With an explicit opt-in consent from the delivery driver, we collect the
      background location data to improve the delivery efficiency including
      delivery tracking, route optimization and ensure seamless customer
      experience. We may retain these data as long as it is necessary for
      operational purposes.
    </p>

    <h3>Information we receive from other sources:</h3>
    <p>
      We collect information from (i) data brokers, from which we purchase data
      to supplement the data we collect; (ii) partners, who offer co-branded
      services, sell or distribute our products and services, or engage in joint
      marketing activities; and (iii) publicly-available sources, including data
      in the public domain.
    </p>

    <h3>Information we collect if you use the service as a Merchant:</h3>
    <p>
      If you sign up to be a Merchant on the Service, we collect information
      about you and your employees, such as any and all information related to
      your business, your first and last name, email address, telephone number,
      postal address, enforcement agency permit numbers, licenses (where
      applicable), hours of operation, government issued I.D. (such as a
      driver’s license), demographic data, precise geolocations
      (latitude/longitude), account credentials, financial information, and
      other information collected by our service provider(s) who assist with
      providing the Service for Merchants. We use this information to create and
      administer your Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store account and facilitate
      communications between you and individuals who purchase items from you
      through the Service.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies:</h3>
    <p>
      We use cookies to operate and administer our Site, gather Usage
      Information on our Site, support security features, bring you advertising
      off the Service, and improve your experience on it. A “cookie” is a piece
      of information sent to your browser by a website you visit. Cookies can be
      stored on your computer for different periods of time. Some cookies expire
      after a certain amount of time, or upon logging out (session cookies),
      others survive after your browser is closed until a defined expiration
      date set in the cookie (as determined by the party placing it) and help
      recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet
      again (persistent cookies). For more details on cookies please visit
      www.allaboutcookies.org.
    </p>

    <h3>Pixels:</h3>
    <p>
      We use pixels (also known as web beacons), which is code embedded in a
      website, video, email, or advertisement, to send information about your
      use of the Service to a server. There are various types of pixels,
      including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript
      pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video,
      email, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or
      a separate entity to drop or read cookies on your browser. Pixels are used
      in combination with cookies to track activity by a particular browser on a
      particular device. We may incorporate pixels from separate entities,
      including Facebook and GetEmail, that allow us to track our conversions,
      bring you advertising off the Service (such as by associating an email
      address with the browser or device used to access the Service), and
      provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect
      our Service with your social media account.
    </p>
    <h3>Analytics:</h3>
    <p>
      We use analytics services, such as Google Analytics, a web analytics
      service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) and/or others. These analytics
      services use cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance
      your experience when you use the Site. For more information on how Google
      uses this data, go to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. To opt
      out of the use of certain information collected by Google Analytics visit
      https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and
      https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/ for Google Analytics for
      Display Advertising or the Google Display Network at.
    </p>
    <h3>Online Tracking and Do Not Track Signals:</h3>
    <p>
      We and our analytics and advertising providers, including Facebook, may
      use cookies, pixels or other tracking technologies to collect information
      about your browsing activities over time and across different websites
      following your use of the Site and use that information to send targeted
      advertisements. For example, we place ads through Google and Facebook that
      you may view on their platforms as well as on other websites and services.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also use audience matching services (which is a type of targeted
      advertising) to reach people (or people similar to people) who have
      visited our Service or are identified in one or more of our databases
      (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us providing a list of hashed email
      addresses to an ad partner or incorporating a pixel from an ad partner
      into our own Service, and the ad partner matching common factors between
      our data and their data. For instance, we incorporate the Facebook pixel
      on our Service and may share your email address with Facebook as part of
      our use of Facebook Custom Audiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      The parties we work with to provide you with targeted advertising may act
      as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how
      to process your information. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with
      and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our Site currently does not respond to “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals and
      operates as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal
      is received. If we do respond to DNT signals in the future, we will update
      this Privacy Policy to describe how we do so. For more information on DNT,
      visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.
    </p>

      <li>To develop new products and services;</li>
      <li>
        To prevent fraud, criminal activity, or misuses of our Service, breach

        architecture and networks;
      </li>
      <li>
        To conduct promotions, including verifying your eligibility and if

      </li>
      <li>
        To comply with legal obligations and legal process and to protect our
        rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you

      <li>To fulfil any other purpose at your direction; and</li>
      <li>With notice to you and your consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aggregated or De-Identified Information:</h3>
    <p>
      We may aggregate or de-identify information in a form that does not

    </p>

    <h3>Marketing:</h3>
    <p>

      communications sent to your telephone number, we use that information to
      send you special offers. You may opt out of receiving promotional emails
      by following the instructions contained in each promotional email we send
      you. You can also control the marketing emails and/or text messages you
      receive by updating your settings through your account. You can opt-out of
      receiving text messages or calls to your phone number at any time by (i)
      for text messages, texting “STOP” in response to any text message you
      receive from us; and (ii) for calls, requesting opt-out during any call
      you receive from us. In addition, if at any time you do not wish to
      receive future marketing communications via your email address, you may
      contact us at support@Grabbl.io. If you unsubscribe from our marketing
      lists, you will no longer receive marketing communications, but we may
      still contact you regarding management of your account, other
      administrative matters, and to respond to your requests.
    </p>

    <h2>3. SHARING AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>

    <p>
      We share your information that we collect in accordance with the practices
      described in this Privacy Policy. The categories of parties with whom we
      share information is set forth below:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Service Providers:</b> To assist us in meeting business operations
        needs and to perform certain services and functions, we share
        information with service providers, including providers of hosting
        services, cloud services and other information technology services
        providers, email communication software and email newsletter services,
        payment processors, customer relationship management and customer
        support services, and web analytics services (for more details on the
        parties that place cookies through the Site, please see the “Cookies”
        and “Analytics” sections above). Pursuant to our instructions, these
        parties will access, process or store information in the course of
        performing their duties to us, although we may permit them to use
        information that does not identify you (including information that has
        been aggregated or de-identified) for any purpose except as prohibited
        by applicable law.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Merchants:</b> We share information with Merchants on the Service
        (each , a “Merchant”) in order to facilitate your orders, provide

        law.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Vendors and Other Parties:</b> We share information with vendors and
        other parties for analytics, advertising, delivery and marketing related

      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Other Users of the Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store Website:</b> In certain
        jurisdictions where third party delivery may be restricted or limited,
        we share information with other users of the Service who need access to
        your information (for example your geo location, home address and
        telephone number) in order to complete an order (i.e. pick up an item,
        deliver an item, etc. ). If you receive another user’s information, you
        agree to use it only for the purpose in which it was provided (i.e. to
        complete the transaction).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Partners:</b> We share information with our partners in connection
        with offering co-branded services, selling or distributing our products,

        <b>Promotions:</b> Our promotions may be jointly sponsored or offered by
        other parties. When you voluntarily enter a promotion, we share
        information as set out in the official rules that govern the promotion
        as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on
        a winners list). By entering a promotion, you agree to the official
        rules that govern that promotion, and may, except where prohibited by
        applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other entities to use your

        through the Service, such as information in your profile (e.g., your
        profile picture) or your reviews of the Merchants and/or items on the
        Service. Please think carefully before making information public as you
        are solely responsible for any information you make public. Once you
        have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such
        information, subject to additional rights set out in this Privacy
        Policy.

        financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale

        counterparties and others assisting with the transaction and transferred
        to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction along with other
        assets.

        the extent permitted by law we will direct the requesting party to seek
        the data directly from you. If legally required or compelled to disclose
        or give access to your information, we will promptly notify you and
        provide a copy of the demand unless legally prohibited from doing so.

      Our app may request to access your device’s camera to enable specific
      features such as uploading images, scanning QR codes or identity

    <p>
      Our Service is not directed to children and is intended for a general
      audience. Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store does not knowingly collect personal
      information (as defined by the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection
      Act, or “COPPA”) from children. If you are a parent or guardian and have
      reason to believe that your child has provided information to Grabbl
      and/or Grabbl Store through the Service, please contact us at
      support@Grabbl.io and we will endeavor to delete that information from our
      databases in accordance with COPPA.

    <p>
      The Service may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled
      by Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store, including social media services. The
      information that you share with and that is collected by these other
      parties will be governed by the specific privacy policies and terms of
      service of the other party and not by this Privacy Policy. By providing
      these links we do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed these sites.
      Please contact the other party directly for information on their privacy
      practices and policies.
    </p>

    <h2>9. SECURITY</h2>
    <p>
      You use the Service at your own risk. We implement and maintain
      commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational
      measures to protect information about you both online and offline from
      loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or
      destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully
      secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from us may not be
      secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what
      information you send to us via the Service or e-mail. Please keep this in
      mind when disclosing any information to Grabbl and/or Grabbl Store via the
      Internet.
    </p>

      updated version on this page, unless another type of notice is required by
      the applicable law. By continuing to use our Service or providing us with
      information after we have posted an updated Privacy Policy, or notified
      you by other means if applicable, you consent to the then posted Privacy
      Policy and practices described in it.
